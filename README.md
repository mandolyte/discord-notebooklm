## What's Here

There are folders which are named after the Discord channel. In each are data and scripts used to export the chat log.

## Process 

### Automation

As of 2025-03-15, a Go language script has been written to automate the detailed steps below. It is located in the folder `main`. Run the script `sh runAll.sh` to use the automation.

Example execution will be similar to the below:

```
$ sh runAll.sh

### Forum Style Channels

Since each post in a forum is a thread, I have to obtain all the thread numbers for the forum and export them individually. 

*For NLM, there are just two forum style channels that I am doing: Bugs and Feature Requests. So the following only applies to these two channels.*

Here are the steps:

First, use the `get_active_threads.sh` script to obtain the active posts from all the channels. The output for this will be `input.txt`. 

Sample output:

```
$ ./get_active_threads.sh 
Start at Sat Oct 19 09:33:24 AM BST 2024
Done at Sat Oct 19 09:33:47 AM BST 2024
```

Second, open the file and locate the forum channel of interest and copy/paste those lines into the channel subfolder with the same name, namely, "input.txt"

Third, run the `export.sh` script to loop thru the thread number file, exporting each chat.

The script creates a log file named `export.log` and will concatenate all the exported chats into one text file named `Active_${CHANNEL}.txt`.

### Regular Channels

For regular channels it isn't required to fetch each message individually. The `use-cases` folder is a regular channel. The channel id is required and all the messages will be exported in one command. See script for details.

## Appendix A - List of Server Channels and IDs

Below shows the command and the output.

The discord server ID ("guild") may easily be found by inspecting the URL while using the web version of discord. The above for example, came from: 

```
https://discord.com/channels/1124402182171672732
```
